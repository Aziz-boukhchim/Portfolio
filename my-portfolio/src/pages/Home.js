    <h2>LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF</h2>
    <p>
      I am a passionate software developer with a keen interest in building innovative and scalable web applications. My journey in programming began with exploring languages like JavaScript, Python, and C++, and I've continued to expand my skill set ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      I specialize in web development, working with modern JavaScript frameworks such as React.js and Next.js, and I have hands-on experience building full-stack applications. My goal is to create clean, efficient code while maintaining a focus on delivering exceptional user experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond web development, I'm also fascinated by cloud technologies and DevOps practices, especially with platforms like AWS and Docker. I enjoy experimenting with new tools and techniques to improve my workflow and keep learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I‚Äôm not coding, you can find me developing 3D games using Unity, exploring the latest tech trends, or collaborating with other developers on exciting projects.
